A place to keep track of my screeps scripts.

Screeps is a game where you automate units and base building using a JavaScript script that runs every game tick (~3 seconds).
You compete against many other players for resources.

My code is fairly basic right now. I'm avoiding tutorials and guides until I've explored most of the game mechanics myself.
